## 🕸  Familiar Web Crawling & Slack Bot

One of the most exciting parts was learning web automation using Selenium and connecting it with Slack for real-time alerts.

## 📊 Data Analysis: From Pandas to Plotly
In the data analysis part of the course, I got hands-on experience with powerful tools:

- Numpy: Numerical operations and array handling

- Pandas: Data cleaning and table manipulation

- Seaborn / Matplotlib: Basic data visualization

- Plotly: Interactive and dynamic charts
