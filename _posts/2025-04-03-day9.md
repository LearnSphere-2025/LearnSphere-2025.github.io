This post is a reflection on that exciting and fulfilling journey.

## 💻 Python Basics: A New Language, Slowly Becoming Familiar 

At first, even **Python's indentation** was unfamiliar.  
I started with variables, conditionals, loops, and functions — the very basics of programming.

## 🕸  Familiar Web Crawling & Slack Bot

One of the most exciting parts was learning web automation using Selenium and connecting it with Slack for real-time alerts.
I built a small project where I could collect data and send updates directly to my Slack workspace.
From data collection to processing and notification, I could finally understand what a real data pipeline looks like, even on a small scale.

## 📊 Data Analysis: From Pandas to Plotly
In the data analysis part of the course, I got hands-on experience with powerful tools:

- Numpy: Numerical operations and array handling

- Pandas: Data cleaning and table manipulation

- Seaborn / Matplotlib: Basic data visualization

- Plotly: Interactive and dynamic charts

## 🌱 Mini project

Starting a mini project using public datasets and my personal interests

📓 [Download Crawled Data (CSV)](/assets/data/naver_news_직장내 괴롭힘_2025.03.31_2025.04.02.csv)  

🔍 Summary of Text Mining on Workplace Bullying News (March 31 – April 2, 2025)
"Workplace bullying News" were collected in naver website. I analyzed 30 news summaries related to workplace bullying using four text mining techniques:

(1) Keyword Frequency Analysis
Most frequent terms were: Human Rights, Workplace, Bullying, Agreement, Policy, Education, Integrity, Gender Equality, etc.

This reflects a focus on workplace bullying as a human rights and institutional issue.

(2) Word Cloud Visualization
The word cloud highlights dominant keywords such as “Human Rights”, “Bullying”, “Education”, and “Gender Equality”, indicating emphasis on awareness, training, and policy efforts.

(3) TF-IDF Analysis
Identified article-specific keywords like: Rebate (whistleblower case in a hospital), Blind Spot (legal protection gaps), Caddy (case of harassment in golf industry)

These illustrate how individual incidents and legal shortcomings are being reported.

(4) LDA Topic Modeling
Four main topics were detected: Legal & institutional improvements, Government/public education initiatives, Human rights cooperation policies, Specific case reports and controversies

Overall, the media’s focus was on promoting preventive education, legal frameworks, and public cooperation to address workplace bullying.
