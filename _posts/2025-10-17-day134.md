# Kernel Academy AI Bootcamp (October 17, 2025)  
**Model development and experiments for a receipt OCR detection competition**

---

## 📌 Problem Definition & Key Settings

- **Task**: Detect text regions in receipt images using deep learning-based OCR detection models  
- **Baseline**: Initial h-mean score of 0.80+ with local results closely matching the leaderboard → **stable experimental environment**  
- **Backbone**: Larger models gave better performance but exceeded GPU limits → **mid-size model selected**  
- **Input Resolution**: Higher resolutions improved performance, but due to resource constraints, we chose **704px** as a balanced setting

## 🧪 Pre/Post-processing & Visualization Outcomes

- ❌ **CLAHE / Deskew / Denoise**: Performance dropped → **discarded**  
- ❌ **Background Removal**: Also led to degraded performance  
- ✅ **Post-processing (thresh & box_thresh)**: Helped improve **precision**  
- ⚠️ **Label Noise**: Due to characteristics of Cleval evaluation, noise had minimal impact → **continued without label correction**

## ⚙️ Leaderboard Snapshot

- **Framework**: `PyTorch Lightning 2.x`, `Hydra 1.2`
- **Environment**: `Python 3.10+`, `CUDA 12.x`, `Ubuntu 22.04`
- **Dataset**:  Provided train/val/test set  & External public data with **pseudo labels**
- **Model**: `ecaresnet50d(DBHead/U-Net) + 704 scale + TTA + 후처리(thresh=0.2, box_thresh=0.35)`  
- **Local Test h-mean=0.9768, Public Leaderboard=0.9815, Private Leaderboard=0.9805**

## 🔁 Reflections & Takeaways

I learned the importance of visualization from our mentor, along with practical techniques to implement it. Rather than relying solely on metric scores, I learned to visualize the model predictions to inspect detection quality.

Thanks to visualization, I could identify false positives/negatives and use these insights to fine-tune the model further, leading to improved performance.
