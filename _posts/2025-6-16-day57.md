Deep learning has rapidly evolved from rule-based systems to massive language models. In this post, I summarize its development stages, core learning paradigms, optimization techniques, and representative models that have shaped modern AI.

## 🔁 Five Stages of Deep Learning Evolution

1. **Rule-based Programming**  
   All logic and rules are manually coded by humans.

2. **Conventional Machine Learning**  
   Humans define features, and models learn patterns from them.

3. **Deep Learning**  
   Both feature extraction and decision-making are automated.  
   Key architecture: **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)**  
   - Composed of multiple hidden layers that learn complex patterns  
   - Structure: Input → Hidden layers → Output layer

   Training involves:
   - **Gradient Descent**: Updates model weights to minimize error
   - **Backpropagation**: Propagates error backwards to adjust weights
   - **Loss Function**: Measures how far predictions are from actual targets

4. **Pre-training & Fine-tuning**  
   Models are first trained on large general datasets, then fine-tuned for specific tasks.  
   Key techniques:
   - **Weight Initialization**: Crucial for stable training
   - **Regularization**: Prevents overfitting (e.g., Dropout, L2)
   - **Learning Rate**: Controls training speed; requires careful tuning
   - **Optimizers**: Methods for updating parameters, such as SGD or Adam

5. **Big Models & In-context Learning**  
   Large models like ChatGPT can solve tasks via context without additional training.  
   Few-shot and zero-shot learning become possible through prompt engineering.

## 🧠 Learning Paradigms in Deep Learning

- **Supervised Learning**: Learns from labeled data with known outputs
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Finds structure in data without labels
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Learns policies through interaction and reward feedback

## 📊 Classification by Data Type and Task

- **Structured Data**: Tabular numeric/categorical data for classification or regression
- **Unstructured Data**: Images, text, audio processed via deep models after preprocessing
- **By Task**
  - **Recognition**: Outputs structured info like class or coordinates
  - **Generation**: Creates new unstructured data (text, images, audio)

## 🌟 Core Techniques and Representative Models

- **Data Augmentation**: Enhances generalization by modifying training data (rotation, crop, etc.)
- **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)**: Excellent for image recognition, extracts spatial features
- **RNN (Recurrent Neural Network)**: Ideal for sequential data like text or time series
- **AlexNet**: A milestone CNN that popularized deep learning (ILSVRC 2012 winner)
- **ChatGPT**: A large-scale language model capable of contextual reasoning and text generation
