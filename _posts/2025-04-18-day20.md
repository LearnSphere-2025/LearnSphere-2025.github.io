# Kernel Academy AI Bootcamp (April 18, 2025)

This week was all about diving deep into core computer science subjects.  
From data structures to software engineering, I spent five intense days laying the foundation for solid CS knowledge.  
It was challenging but extremely rewarding ‚Äî I could feel the concepts starting to come together.

## üß± Data Structures

I studied how data can be organized and managed efficiently in computer memory.

- Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Heaps, Graphs
- Time complexity comparisons and selection strategies
- Practiced implementing them in Python

Understanding **Time complexity** and ** Tree concept** was especially helpful for connecting to algorithms.

## üß† Algorithms

I learned the principles behind solving problems efficiently.

- Sorting: Selection, Insertion, Quick, Merge
- Searching: Binary Search, DFS, BFS
- Dynamic Programming (DP), Backtracking
- Solved real-world problems on coding platforms

Comparing recursion and DP side-by-side in code really helped solidify my understanding.

## üóÉ Database

I explored both SQL basics and database design principles.

- Relational data model
- SQL syntax (SELECT, JOIN, GROUP BY, etc.)
- Normalization & anomalies
- Transactions, integrity, and indexing

Designing ER diagrams and writing actual queries gave me hands-on experience.

## üñ• Computer Architecture & Operating Systems

This section helped me understand how computers work under the hood.

- CPU, memory, and register functions
- Instruction cycle & pipelining
- OS essentials: processes, threads, memory management, scheduling

---

## üåê Networking & Software Engineering

I gained insight into how the internet works and how to build software systematically.

### Networking
- OSI 7-layer model and 4-layer model& TCP/IP
- HTTP, DNS, SSL/TLS
- Packet flow and routing

### Software Engineering
- Waterfall vs Agile methodology
- Requirements analysis, design, testing lifecycle
- AI chatbot using Windsurf and Gemini API

## ‚úçÔ∏è Reflection

It was a packed week of learning, but I now feel more grounded in CS fundamentals.  
Though I still need more practice to fully master these topics, it feels great to have built a strong base. Next section, I‚Äôll start applying these concepts through hands-on projects!
