# Kernel Academy AI Bootcamp (September 19, 2025)

The importance of accurate information retrieval and answer generation in conversational AI systems is increasingly growing. This post shares our experience building a IR system based on RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) that answers Korean science knowledge questions.

## 🪢 System Architecture
: Core Tech Stack: Elasticsearch 8.8.0, KLUE RoBERTa Large, OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo

The system consists of two main stages: 
- Retrieval Stage: Elasticsearch hybrid search (BM25 + Dense Vector)
- Generation Stage: OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo Function Calling-based answer generation

## 🪢 Hybrid Search Implementation
BM25: Precise term matching with Nori analyzer for Korean morphological analysis
Dense Vector: Semantic similarity capture with KLUE RoBERTa for Korean embedding optimization

I combined both approaches using RRF (Reciprocal Rank Fusion) algorithm, with optimal performance achieved at 90% BM25 and 10% Dense ratio.

## 🪢 Two-Stage Generation with Function Calling
Unlike traditional RAG, the baseline introduced a Function Calling pattern:
Stage 1: Generate independent search queries
Stage 2: Generate answers using Top-3 documents as context

## 🪢 Korean-Specific Optimizations
Morphological Analysis: Nori analyzer for compound word decomposition and stopword removal
KLUE Embeddings: 1024-dimensional vectors capturing semantic relationships in Korean scientific terminology


## 🪢 Development Challenges
Initially, we had an issue where only BM25 was actually used despite hybrid search being defined. We resolved this through code refactoring and unit testing.
Performance Optimizations: 100-unit batch processing, parallel BM25 and Dense search execution, Elasticsearch bulk indexing

## 🪢 Experimental Results
Hybrid search showed performance improvements across keyword questions (BM25), semantic questions (Dense), and complex questions (complementary benefits). Function Calling introduction enabled more accurate search queries and structured answers.

The most important aspect of building a RAG system was domain-specific optimization. For Korean processing, morphological analysis and language model selection were crucial, with hybrid search ratio tuning significantly affecting performance.
