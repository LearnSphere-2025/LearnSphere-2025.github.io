# Kernel Academy AI Bootcamp (April 23, 2025)

Understanding version control is an essential skill for every developer. Today, I studied the basics of Git — from core concepts to practical commands — and practiced them hands-on with my teammates.

## 🧠 What is Git?

Git is a **Distributed Version Control System (DVCS)**.  
It allows multiple developers to manage their code independently while keeping track of every change, even offline. This makes collaboration flexible and powerful.

## 🔧 Tools & Commands Covered

### 🐚 Shell Commands
I used basic terminal commands to navigate the project directory and execute Git workflows.

### ✍️ Vim Commands
We edited files using Vim — a lightweight text editor — to get comfortable with quick changes and saves.

### 📄 Markdown
Documentation matters! I practiced writing `README.md` files using markdown syntax:  
- `#` for headings  
- `-` for lists  
- `**bold**` and `_italic_` for emphasis  

### 🐙 GitHub
We connected our local Git repositories to GitHub.  
This helped us learn how to push code to a **remote repository**, manage branches, and collaborate with others online.

### 📌 Conventional Commits
We used **conventional commit prefixes** to keep commit messages meaningful and consistent.  
Some examples:
- `feat`: new feature  
- `fix`: bug fix  
- `docs`: documentation changes

### 🌿 Branching
We created and worked on feature branches, then practiced merging them into the `main` branch. This taught us how to develop in isolation and deal with potential merge conflicts.

## ⚙️ Git Task Flow Overview

Here’s a summary of the Git object flow and related commands we practiced:

| Step | Git Object | Command | Description |
|------|------------|---------|-------------|
| 1 | `blob` | `vi README.md` | Create or edit a file |
| 2 | `tree` | `git add README.md` | Stage the file |
| 3 | `commit` | `git commit -m "feat: add README"` | Save changes to history |
| 4 | remote | `git push origin main` | Push to GitHub |

## 👥 Team Practice Session

We wrapped up the session with a **team practice exercise**.  
In pairs or small groups, we simulated a collaborative Git workflow:
- Created branches for individual tasks
- Made commits using proper prefixes
- Pushed to a shared GitHub repository
- Reviewed each other's pull requests

It was a great way to **reinforce learning through real collaboration** and get a feel for how teams manage codebases in the real world.
