# Kernel Academy AI Bootcamp (June 2025)

Over the past few weeks, I’ve been diving into the world of **MLOps**—learning essential tools and applying them in a real-world team project.  
In this post, I’ll reflect on what I learned while building a **cloud-based machine learning web service**, both as a team and through a personal mini project.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies Used

- **AWS S3**: Cloud storage for data  
- **MLflow**: Experiment tracking and model versioning  
- **Docker**: Containerization for portability  
- **Airflow**: Workflow orchestration and automation  
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD pipeline automation  
- **FastAPI**: Backend API server  
- **Streamlit**: Lightweight frontend for ML apps

## ☁️ Team Project: Weekly Temperature Forecast & Outfit Recommendation

### 📌 Goal

Using a public API from the Korean Meteorological Administration,  
we built an MVP-level service that **predicts hourly temperatures for the next 7 days**  
and **recommends appropriate outfits** based on those forecasts.

### 🧠 My Role in the Team

- I focused on **testing early-stage versions** of each process in the pipeline  
- While my code wasn't merged into the final build, I played a role in **validating functionality and giving feedback**  
- It was my first time working with MLOps and backend workflows, so I focused on **understanding the full picture**

## 💡 Mini Project: Wind Speed Forecast Web Service

### Goal

Apart from the team project, I developed my own small ML pipeline to **predict wind speed** using public data.

### ✅ Features

1. **Airflow-based automation pipeline**
   - From data preprocessing → model training → saving pickle files  
2. **Docker-based containerization** for all processes  
3. Attempted integration with **FastAPI** for API deployment

### 🚧 Challenges

Unfortunately, I couldn't complete the FastAPI integration before the project deadline.  
Still, building a functional Airflow pipeline from scratch was a **huge personal achievement**.

## 🌱 Reflections & Growth

- I now understand the end-to-end structure of modern ML systems thanks to this hands-on experience
- I learned how MLOps tools work **in a real development pipeline**, not just in theory
- Although I wasn’t able to contribute production-ready code, I’m confident I’ll be more hands-on in future projects
