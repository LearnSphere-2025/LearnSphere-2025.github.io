# Kernel Academy AI Bootcamp (October 3, 2025)

It's the start of a 7-day holiday break! 🎉  
Instead of just resting, I decided to take on a Kaggle competition to apply everything I've learned in the AI Bootcamp. This is a great opportunity to test my practical skills in a real-world scenario.

## 🗺 Understanding the Competition

The competition is about **identifying mathematical misunderstandings** in students’ free-text responses.

- **Input**: Open-ended answers written by students (in English)
- **Output**: predefined misconceptions (multi-label classification)

What makes it unique:
1. It's a text classification task in the **education domain**
2. The target is **multi-label**, not single label
3. It uses **real, unstructured student-written responses**

It’s an exciting blend of NLP, classification, and educational AI.

## 🧱 Building the Baseline with DeBERTa-v3-base

For Day 1, my goal was to fully understand the task and build a baseline solution. Thanks to the Kernel Academy AI Bootcamp, I was already familiar with HuggingFace Transformers and inference pipelines.

### ✔ Model Used
- `microsoft/deberta-v3-base`

## ⚙️ Core Workflow
1. Load data → Preprocess text (`clean_text`)
2. Handle rare labels + remove duplicates
3. Perform question-aware Stratified K-Fold split
4. Tokenize with DeBERTa (max_len = 256)
5. Train the model (Focal Loss / Weighted BCE + SWA)
6. Save the best model with early stopping
7. Make ensemble predictions (average over folds)
8. Submit Top-3 predicted labels

## 💬 Reflection

Having already built LLM pipelines before, I was able to get a working baseline. The journey is just beginning — but being able to go from scratch to baseline on my own feels incredibly rewarding.
