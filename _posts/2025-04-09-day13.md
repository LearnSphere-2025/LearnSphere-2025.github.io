# Kernel Academy AI Bootcamp (April 9, 2025)

To understand and apply machine learning algorithms effectively, statistical thinking and mathematical foundations are essential. I learned a wide range of topics—from probability theory to estimation and hypothesis testing and matrix operations and binary classification.
This learning experience deepened my understanding of how machine learning models learn, predict, and make decisions based on mathematical logic and statistics.

## 📚 Day 1. Basics of Statistics
- Counting principles: Addition and Multiplication rules
- Permutation & Combination
- Probability theory: fundamental terms, mathematical vs statistical probability
- Descriptive vs Inferential statistics
- Basic concepts of vectors and matrices

---

## 📚 Day 2. Linking Statistics and Linear Algebra
- Matrix multiplication
- Hands-on matrix computation using PyTorch
- Mean vector & Covariance matrix
- Image reflection via matrix operations (left-right & top-bottom flip)

---

## 📚 Day 3. Statistical Estimation and Hypothesis Testing
- Point Estimation vs Interval Estimation
- Confidence intervals and standard error
- Hypothesis setting (Null vs Alternative)
- Error types (Type I & II)
- Significance level, p-value, and test methods (two-tailed & one-tailed)
- Logistic Regression

---

## 📚 Day 4. Machine Learning and Binary Classification
- Partial derivative, chain rule
- Gradient descent
- Orange software



## ✨ More importantly, I realized that statistical concepts are not just background knowledge—they are core tools for interpreting, tuning, and improving machine learning models.
